                <p>The Sign Language Translator project aims to bridge the communication
                    gap between sign language users and non-sign language users. Sign language
                    is a visual language used by individuals with hearing impairments to
                    communicate. However, many people who do not understand sign language
                    face difficulties in understanding and interacting with sign language users.
                    The project addresses this challenge by developing a machine learning-based
                    solution that translates sign language gestures into text or spoken language.</p>
